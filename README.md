# ConVer : Comprehensive and Scalable Network Configuration Verification

This is the initial version of the code, where we use the Batfish parser. The relevant ConVer code is located in the directories /projects/batfish-common-protocol/src/main/java/org/batfish/symwork and /projects/batfish/src/main/java/org/batfish/extwork, while the network used for the experiment is under the /exp-network directory.

Finally, the user-friendly version of the code will be uploaded soon.
